# Typescript Minesweeper

This project implements a simple minesweeper game implemented using Typescript, React, and Redux. The purpose is to learn about how those three things fit together, as opposed to providing any sort of entertainment value.

## Getting the code

```shell
git clone https://github.com/james-howard/tssweeper
cd tssweeper
npm install # install dependencies
```

## Building the project

```shell
npm run build
```

The built product will be available in the `build` directory with index.html as the entry point. You should be able to just double click it, no web server needed.

## Running the debug server

```shell
npm run start
```

A debug web server will start running on localhost:3000 and your default browser will open to that address. Any code changes will be reflected live.

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```
